They prioritize, assess, evaluate, and report information obtained from SIGINT collection, cyber surveillance, and reconnaissance operations sources. The TAR enhances reporting with collateral information as required, maintains awareness of internal and external customer requirements, and collaborates with other collectors and analysts to refine collection and reporting requirements. The TAR shares target-related information and provides feedback to customers as appropriate. The TAR develops working aids and provides database updates on target activity to enhance and build target knowledge and improve collection. The TAR performs quality control and product-release functions.",
