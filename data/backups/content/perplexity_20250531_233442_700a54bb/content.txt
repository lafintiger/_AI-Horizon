# AI's Impact on Cybersecurity Workforce: 2024-2025 Analysis

The cybersecurity job market has undergone significant transformation during 2024-2025, particularly due to the integration of artificial intelligence. This period has seen both challenges and opportunities for cybersecurity professionals as AI reshapes the industry landscape.

## Emerging Job Roles and Market Growth

The AI security engineering field has experienced substantial growth in 2024-2025, with several new specialized roles emerging:

**AI Security Engineers** have seen dramatic salary increases, jumping by more than $50,000 from the previous year's average of $155,000[1]. This reflects the growing demand for professionals who can secure AI systems and implement AI-powered security solutions.

**Heads of Security** and **Product Security Engineers** positions have increased as organizations recognize the need for specialized AI security leadership[2]. These roles focus on managing the unique security challenges posed by AI implementation within enterprise environments.

**AI Research Scientists** and **Machine Learning Engineers** have experienced explosive growth, with job openings increasing by 80% and 70% respectively since 2023[3]. This contrasts sharply with declining demand for traditional roles like mobile engineers, frontend developers, and data engineers, which dropped by more than 20% in the same period.

## Skills in Demand

The cybersecurity workforce is experiencing a shift in required skill sets:

**Cloud expertise** has become essential for AI security professionals, with specific platforms dominating job requirements:
- Microsoft Azure appears in 33% of AI engineer job postings, valued for its enterprise integration and responsible AI features
- AWS is mentioned in 26% of postings, prized for its flexibility and scalability for AI workloads[1]

Notably, AWS has overtaken Azure in popularity compared to 2024, indicating a market shift toward AWS cloud systems for AI security implementations.

**AI governance skills** have become increasingly valuable as organizations implement frameworks to ensure responsible AI use. This includes expertise in regulatory compliance, risk assessment, and ethical AI deployment.

**MLSecOps** (Machine Learning Security Operations) has emerged as a critical discipline, combining DevSecOps principles with machine learning pipeline security.

## Market Outlook and Challenges

The cybersecurity job market shows mixed signals for different career stages:

**Mid-level and executive positions** are opening up again after a period of contraction, with numerous opportunities at new startups seeking their first security hires[2].

**Entry-level positions** face a more challenging outlook. The cybersecurity field, once considered a hot career path, has cooled significantly. AI's ability to handle routine tasks has reduced demand for junior talent, with this trend expected to accelerate in 2026 and beyond as agentic AI matures[2][3].

A concerning trend is that many new programmers are focusing on prompting AI models rather than developing fundamental coding skills, potentially creating a skills gap in understanding the underlying security principles[3].

## Transformation of Cybersecurity Teams

The integration of AI into cybersecurity operations is rapidly changing how security teams function:

**Team structures** are evolving to incorporate AI specialists alongside traditional security roles, creating more cross-functional approaches to security challenges[5].

**Operational focus** is shifting from reactive threat response to proactive threat intelligence and AI system governance, requiring security professionals to develop new competencies[5].

As we move through 2025, cybersecurity professionals must remain adaptable, continuously upskilling to leverage AI effectively while maintaining core security expertise. The most successful practitioners will be those who can bridge the gap between traditional cybersecurity knowledge and emerging AI technologies.
