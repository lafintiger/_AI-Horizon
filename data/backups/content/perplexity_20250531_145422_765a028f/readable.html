        <div><p>## AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps, and AI Governance Cybersecurity Jobs: 2024–2025 Market Analysis</p>
<p>**Current Trends and Developments**</p>
<p>The cybersecurity workforce is undergoing rapid transformation as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes deeply embedded in both attack and defense strategies. This shift has created significant demand for specialized roles such as AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps (Machine Learning Security Operations), and AI governance experts. From 2024 to 2025, organizations are actively recruiting professionals who can secure AI systems, develop robust AI governance frameworks, and manage the unique risks posed by machine learning technologies[1][2][5].</p>
<p>**Specific Examples**</p>
<p>- **Amazon** is hiring AI Security Engineers to work directly with development teams, focusing on securing AI applications, reviewing code for vulnerabilities, building security frameworks, and developing automation tools for AI security[3].
- **AT&amp;T** has an Associate Director role for Cybersecurity - AI Security Engineering, responsible for designing security protocols for AI systems, monitoring threats, developing secure coding standards, and conducting adversarial testing of AI models[5].
- **Vectra AI** and similar companies are expanding teams of security researchers and data scientists to address AI-driven threats and develop AI-powered defense mechanisms[4].</p>
<p>**Expert Opinions and Studies**</p>
<p>Industry leaders and experts emphasize that the integration of AI into cybersecurity is creating new job categories and reshaping existing ones. Key areas of focus include:</p>
<p>- **MLSecOps**: This emerging discipline combines machine learning operations (MLOps) with security, requiring professionals to secure the entire machine learning lifecycle—from data ingestion and model training to deployment and monitoring.
- **AI Governance**: As organizations deploy AI at scale, there is a growing need for experts who can ensure compliance, ethical use, and risk management of AI systems, especially in regulated industries.
- **AI Security Engineering**: Security engineers with AI expertise are now essential for developing threat models, conducting adversarial testing, and implementing responsible AI filtering mechanisms[5].</p>
<p>**Concrete Data Points**</p>
<p>- As of 2024–2025, there are hundreds of open positions for AI Security Engineers and Cybersecurity AI Engineers on major job boards, indicating a robust and growing demand[1][2].
- Job descriptions for these roles typically require experience in both cybersecurity and AI/ML, with responsibilities including secure architecture design, threat detection for AI systems, and development of AI-specific security tools[3][5].
- Companies are seeking professionals with advanced degrees in computer science, cybersecurity, or data science, along with industry certifications (e.g., SANS, ISC2, ISACA)[5].</p>
<p>**Impact on the Cybersecurity Workforce and Job Market**</p>
<p>- **Job Creation**: The proliferation of AI in cybersecurity is creating new roles (AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps Engineer, AI Governance Specialist) and expanding the scope of traditional security jobs to include AI-specific responsibilities.
- **Skill Requirements**: There is a premium on hybrid skills—cybersecurity expertise combined with AI/ML proficiency. This trend is driving upskilling initiatives and reshaping cybersecurity education.
- **Workforce Evolution**: Organizations are restructuring teams to include AI security specialists, data scientists, and ethical AI experts, reflecting a shift toward multidisciplinary security operations.</p>
