## AI and Cybersecurity Workforce: Trends, Roles, and Impact (2024–2025)

**Current Trends and Developments**

- The AI and cybersecurity job market is undergoing significant transformation, with AI-related roles expanding rapidly across sectors. In Q1 2025, the U.S. saw 35,445 AI-related positions, marking a 25.2% increase from Q1 2024 and an 8.8% rise from the previous quarter[5].
- While overall cybersecurity job postings have declined since 2022, there is a notable shift in hiring priorities. Certain specialized roles—especially those intersecting AI, privacy, and governance—are experiencing growth despite the broader downturn[2].
- The percentage of all job postings requiring AI skills rose to 1.8% in 2025, up from 1.4% in 2023, indicating a growing demand for AI expertise within the cybersecurity sector and beyond[3].

**Emerging and In-Demand Roles**

- **AI Security Engineer / MLSecOps**: As organizations deploy more machine learning (ML) systems, the need for MLSecOps (Machine Learning Security Operations) professionals has grown. These roles focus on securing AI/ML pipelines, defending against adversarial attacks, and ensuring model integrity.
- **AI Governance and Privacy Engineer**: The complexity of regulatory frameworks has led to a surge in demand for professionals who can ensure compliance, manage AI governance, and address privacy concerns in AI deployments. Job postings for Cybersecurity/Privacy Attorneys, for example, surged by 40.74% from 2023 to 2024, reflecting the regulatory push[2].
- **Machine Learning Privacy Engineer**: With privacy regulations tightening, engineers specializing in privacy-preserving machine learning (such as federated learning and differential privacy) are increasingly sought after.
- **Generative AI Engineer**: The rise of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) has created new roles focused on securing, auditing, and governing generative models, particularly in industries like media, design, and healthcare[4].

**Expert Opinions and Industry Insights**

- Deidre Diamond, CEO of CyberSN, attributes the rise in privacy and governance roles to new regulations and the growing need for legal and compliance expertise within cybersecurity teams[2].
- Industry reports highlight that the AI revolution is not limited to traditional tech hubs. While San Francisco remains a leader, hybrid work has enabled other regions to catch up in AI hiring[4].
- The demand for technical skills such as Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NLP is dominant, but there is also a parallel need for expertise in AI risk management, data governance, and secure ML operations[4].
