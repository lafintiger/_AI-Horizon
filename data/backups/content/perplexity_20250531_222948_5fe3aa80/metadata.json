  "content": "## AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps, and AI Governance: Cybersecurity Jobs Created (2024–2025)\n\n### Current Trends and Developments\n\nThe rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into enterprise systems has significantly impacted the cybersecurity workforce. Organizations are increasingly seeking professionals who can secure AI/ML models and ensure responsible AI governance. This demand is driving the emergence of specialized roles such as AI security engineers, MLSecOps (Machine Learning Security Operations) specialists, and AI governance experts[3].\n\nA 2024 ISC2 survey found that 88% of cybersecurity professionals expect AI to significantly alter their jobs within two years, and 35% say it already has[3]. Companies are responding by upskilling existing staff and creating new hybrid positions that blend AI and cybersecurity expertise[3].\n\n### Specific Examples and Roles\n\n**Emerging AI Cybersecurity Job Titles (2024–2025):**\n- AI/ML Security Engineer: Focuses on securing AI models, conducting architectural assessments, and developing new AI security methodologies. Requires deep knowledge of both cybersecurity and AI/ML systems[3].\n- MLSecOps Specialist: Ensures the security and integrity of machine learning pipelines, including data ingestion, model training, and deployment.\n- AI Security Analyst: Evaluates AI systems for vulnerabilities, conducts risk assessments, and monitors AI governance and compliance[5].\n- GenAI Security Development Manager: Oversees the secure development and deployment of generative AI systems[3].\n- AI Governance and Ethics Specialist: Monitors AI systems for compliance with ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements.\n\nJob postings for these roles are increasing on platforms like Indeed and LinkedIn, with hundreds of listings for AI/ML security, privacy, and analyst positions in 2024–2025[2][5].\n\n### Expert Opinions and Studies\n\nIndustry experts agree that the convergence of AI and cybersecurity is creating new career paths. TechTarget notes that while AI security is still an emerging field, organizations are already hiring for these hybrid roles and developing certifications specific to AI cybersecurity[3]. Upskilling is a major focus, as existing cybersecurity professionals are encouraged to learn about AI/ML technologies to stay relevant.\n\n### Concrete Data Points\n\n- **Job Listings:** As of 2024, there are over 500 open positions for machine learning AI security analysts and nearly 150 for machine learning security/privacy roles on Indeed alone[2][5].\n- **Workforce Impact:** 88% of cybersecurity professionals expect AI to significantly change their jobs within two years (ISC2, 2024)[3].\n- **Skill Requirements:** Most AI/ML security engineering roles require a degree in computer science or related fields and substantial cybersecurity experience—often a decade or more for senior positions[3].\n\n### Impact on the Cybersecurity Workforce and Job Market\n\nThe adoption of AI is not only creating new job titles but also transforming existing cybersecurity roles. Professionals are expected to understand both traditional security principles and the unique risks associated with AI/ML systems. Organizations are prioritizing:\n- AI model integrity and security\n- Secure ML pipeline operations (MLSecOps)\n- AI governance, compliance, and ethical oversight\n\nThis shift is leading to a more interdisciplinary cybersecurity workforce, with increased demand for talent at the intersection of AI, data science, and security[3][4].\n\n### Summary Table: Key AI Cybersecurity Roles (2024–2025)\n\n| Role Title                   | Core Focus                                 | Typical Requirements                |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| AI/ML Security Engineer      | Securing AI models, threat assessments     | CS degree, 10+ years cybersecurity  |\n| MLSecOps Specialist          | Secure ML pipeline operations              | Security + ML/DevOps expertise      |\n| AI Security Analyst          | Risk assessment, AI governance             | Security analysis, AI knowledge     |\n| GenAI Security Dev Manager   | Secure GenAI system development            | AI/ML, security leadership          |\n| AI Governance Specialist     | Ethics, compliance, regulatory oversight   | Policy, legal, AI/ML background     |\n\n### Sources and Credibility\n\n- TechTarget (industry news, expert analysis, ISC2 survey)[3] — High credibility\n- Indeed job listings (real-time labor market data)[2][5] — High credibility\n- Coursera (industry-aligned skills and job trends)[4] — Medium credibility\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:** The rise of AI and machine learning is rapidly creating new cybersecurity job categories, with a strong emphasis on MLSecOps, AI governance, and hybrid AI-security skill sets. The job market is responding with hundreds of new postings and a clear mandate for upskilling, fundamentally reshaping the cybersecurity workforce for 2024 and beyond[3][2][5].",
