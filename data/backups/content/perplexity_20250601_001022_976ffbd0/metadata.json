  "content": "## AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps, and AI Governance Roles: 2024–2025 Trends\n\n**Current Trends and Developments**\n\nThe cybersecurity workforce is experiencing rapid transformation due to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. This shift has led to the emergence of specialized roles such as AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps (Machine Learning Security Operations), and AI Governance Specialist. Demand for these positions is rising sharply as organizations seek to secure AI-powered systems and ensure compliance with evolving regulations.\n\n- Job postings for AI Security Engineers and related roles have surged in 2024–2025, with thousands of openings across the United States and globally[1][3].\n- Companies are prioritizing the security of AI applications, focusing on threat modeling, secure code review, AI-specific risk assessments, and the development of automation tools to mitigate AI-related vulnerabilities[4].\n- MLSecOps is emerging as a discipline that combines traditional DevSecOps practices with the unique security challenges of machine learning pipelines, such as data poisoning, model theft, and adversarial attacks.\n\n**Specific Examples and Job Descriptions**\n\n- Amazon is hiring AI Security Engineers to secure AI applications, conduct code reviews, develop security frameworks, and create automation tools for AI security[4].\n- JPMorgan Chase seeks AI/ML Security Engineers with formal software engineering training and hands-on experience in securing ML systems[5].\n- In Fairfax, VA, there are roles like AI Security Solutions Engineer and Research Lead in AI Security Policy, requiring expertise in AI security, compliance, and policy development[2].\n\n**Expert Opinions and Industry Studies**\n\n- Industry reports from leading consulting firms and cybersecurity organizations highlight that AI is both expanding the threat landscape and creating new job opportunities in cybersecurity.\n- Experts emphasize the need for cybersecurity professionals with hybrid skills in AI, ML, and security engineering, noting that these roles are critical for safeguarding AI-driven business processes and infrastructure.\n\n**Concrete Data Points**\n\n- As of mid-2025, there are over 31,000 AI security job postings in the U.S. alone, with salary ranges typically between $60,000 and $220,000 per year, depending on experience and specialization[1][3].\n- AI Security Engineers are expected to have proficiency in languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, and experience with threat modeling, automation, and AI security research[4].\n- Benefits for these roles often include health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off, reflecting their high value and demand in the market[1].\n\n**AI’s Impact on the Cybersecurity Workforce**\n\n- The integration of AI into cybersecurity is not eliminating jobs but rather shifting the required skill sets and creating new opportunities for specialists in AI security, MLSecOps, and AI governance.\n- Organizations are increasingly seeking professionals who can bridge the gap between AI development and cybersecurity, ensuring that AI systems are robust, compliant, and resilient against emerging threats.\n\n## Summary Table: Key Aspects of Emerging AI Cybersecurity Roles (2024–2025)\n\n| Role Title                  | Core Responsibilities                                   | Skills Required                          | Example Employers     | Salary Range         |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| AI Security Engineer        | Secure AI apps, code review, threat modeling, automation| Python, Java, security frameworks        | Amazon, JPMorgan     | $60k–$220k[1][3][4] |\n| MLSecOps Engineer           | Secure ML pipelines, monitor for attacks, automation    | ML, DevSecOps, data security             | Tech & finance firms | $80k–$200k*         |\n| AI Governance Specialist    | Policy development, compliance, risk management         | AI policy, regulatory knowledge          | Public/private sector| $90k–$180k*         |\n\n*Salary estimates for MLSecOps and AI Governance roles are based on industry trends and similar postings.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe cybersecurity workforce is undergoing significant evolution, with AI driving the creation of new, highly specialized jobs. Roles such as AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps Engineer, and AI Governance Specialist are in high demand, offering competitive salaries and requiring a blend of AI, security, and compliance expertise. This trend is expected to continue through 2025 as organizations prioritize the secure and ethical deployment of AI technologies[1][3][4].",
