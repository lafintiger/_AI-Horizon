  "content": "## AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps, and AI Governance Roles: 2024–2025 Job Market Analysis\n\n**Current Trends and Developments**\n\nArtificial intelligence is rapidly transforming the cybersecurity workforce, driving demand for specialized roles such as AI security engineers, MLSecOps (Machine Learning Security Operations) professionals, and AI governance experts. The integration of AI into cybersecurity operations is fundamentally reshaping job functions, required skill sets, and the overall structure of security teams[5].\n\n- **AI Security Engineers**: There is a strong and growing demand for AI security engineers who can secure AI/ML systems, ensure responsible AI deployment, and defend against AI-driven threats. Job postings for AI-related security roles have surged, with companies seeking expertise in both AI/ML and traditional cybersecurity[1][5].\n- **MLSecOps**: As machine learning becomes central to business operations, MLSecOps roles—focused on the security of ML pipelines and models—are emerging as critical. These professionals are responsible for securing data, models, and infrastructure throughout the ML lifecycle.\n- **AI Governance**: With increasing regulatory scrutiny and ethical concerns, organizations are hiring AI governance experts to oversee compliance, risk management, and responsible AI practices.\n\n**Specific Examples and Data Points**\n\n- **Job Growth**: Job openings for AI scientists grew by 80% and for machine learning engineers by 70% from 2023 to 2025, while demand for traditional roles like mobile and frontend engineers dropped by over 20%[4]. This shift reflects the prioritization of AI-centric security roles.\n- **Cloud Skills**: Cloud platforms such as AWS and Microsoft Azure are now essential for AI security engineers. In 2025, AWS skills were mentioned in 26% of AI engineer job postings, overtaking Azure, which appeared in 33% of postings[1]. Cloud security expertise is now a baseline requirement.\n- **Salary Trends**: The AI engineering job market is booming, with salaries for AI security engineers and related roles projected to rise significantly in 2025 due to high demand and a limited talent pool[3].\n- **Workforce Restructuring**: AI has automated many routine security tasks, reducing the need for entry-level positions but increasing demand for specialized, higher-level roles such as Heads of Security, product security engineers, and vCISOs (virtual Chief Information Security Officers)[2][5].\n\n**Expert Opinions and Studies**\n\n- *Solutions Review* editors note that AI is dramatically restructuring cybersecurity roles, responsibilities, and required skills, pushing professionals to adapt or upskill to remain relevant[5].\n- Industry experts predict that while AI will create more mid-level and executive cybersecurity jobs, it will reduce entry-level opportunities as automation handles more routine tasks[2].\n- The shift toward AI-driven security is also leading to burnout and stress, as productivity expectations rise without proportional increases in staffing or support[4].\n\n**Concrete Data Points**\n\n| Role                       | Job Growth (2023–2025) | Notable Skills Required      | Salary Trend (2025)         |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| AI Security Engineer       | Strong increase        | AI/ML, Cloud (AWS/Azure), Cybersecurity | Rising sharply[1][3]        |\n| MLSecOps                   | Emerging/High demand   | ML pipeline security, DevSecOps | Competitive                 |\n| AI Governance              | Growing                | Compliance, Risk, Responsible AI | Attractive                  |\n\n**Impact on the Cybersecurity Workforce**\n\n- **Upskilling Required**: Cybersecurity professionals must now master AI/ML concepts, cloud security, and automation tools to stay competitive[1][5].\n- **Job Polarization**: There is a bifurcation in the job market—mid-level and executive roles are growing, while entry-level opportunities are shrinking due to AI automation[2][5].\n- **New Specializations**: Roles like MLSecOps and AI governance are becoming mainstream, reflecting the need for security across the entire AI lifecycle and compliance landscape.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe period 2024–2025 is marked by rapid growth in AI-centric cybersecurity jobs, especially for AI security engineers, MLSecOps, and AI governance professionals. These roles offer strong salary prospects and job security for those with the right skills, but also signal a decline in traditional entry-level cybersecurity positions as AI-driven automation takes hold[1][2][3][4][5]. The cybersecurity workforce is being reshaped by AI, requiring continuous upskilling and adaptation to new technologies and regulatory demands.",
