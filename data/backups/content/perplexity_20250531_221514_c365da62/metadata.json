  "content": "## AI Automation in Vulnerability Assessment, Incident Response, and Threat Detection (2024–2025)\n\n**Current Trends and Developments**\n\nAI is rapidly transforming core cybersecurity functions, particularly in vulnerability assessment, incident response, and threat detection. In 2024 and into 2025, organizations are increasingly leveraging AI to automate routine and complex security tasks, aiming to address workforce shortages and improve operational efficiency.\n\n- **Vulnerability Assessment:** AI-driven tools are now capable of automating vulnerability scanning and patch management, reducing the need for manual intervention and freeing up human analysts to focus on more strategic work[3][4].\n- **Threat Detection:** AI systems are deployed to monitor network traffic, analyze logs, and detect anomalous behavior in real time, enabling faster and more accurate identification of threats[2][4][5].\n- **Incident Response:** AI-powered security orchestration platforms can automate the initial triage, containment, and even some remediation steps during security incidents, streamlining the response process and minimizing human error[4].\n\n**Specific Examples**\n\n- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** AI cybersecurity tools can now autonomously scan for vulnerabilities across IT environments, prioritize risks, and sometimes even initiate patching without direct human oversight[3][4].\n- **Threat Intelligence Gathering:** AI uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract and correlate threat intelligence from unstructured sources such as forums and threat reports, providing actionable insights for defenders[4].\n- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** Companies like Fortinet utilize AI to continuously monitor access attempts, identify new malware variants, and generate security alerts, allowing for near-instantaneous threat detection and reporting[5].\n- **Security Operations Automation:** AI-driven orchestration platforms automate repetitive tasks such as log analysis, alert triage, and basic incident response actions, significantly reducing the workload for security teams[3][4].\n\n**Expert Opinions and Studies**\n\n- According to the 2024 Hyperproof Benchmark Report, 65% of cybersecurity professionals expect AI to help with workflow optimization, and 52% believe AI will aid in completing manual tasks.
