## AI's Impact on Cybersecurity Workforce (2024–2025)

**Current Trends and Developments**

- The cybersecurity job market is experiencing renewed growth in 2024–2025, particularly for mid-level and executive roles, driven by the proliferation of AI technologies and the need for robust security measures around them[5].
- AI adoption is accelerating across sectors, leading to the emergence of specialized roles such as AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps (Machine Learning Security Operations), and AI Governance professionals[3][4].
- There is a notable shift: while AI is creating new, advanced cybersecurity positions, it is also beginning to reduce the number of traditional entry-level jobs, a trend expected to intensify as AI systems become more autonomous[5].

**Specific Examples and Roles**

- **AI Security Engineer:** This role focuses on securing AI/ML systems, ensuring models are robust against adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model theft. Demand for these engineers is rising as organizations deploy more AI in critical operations[3][4].
- **MLSecOps:** Machine Learning Security Operations professionals are tasked with integrating security into the ML lifecycle—covering data integrity, model monitoring, and incident response for AI-driven systems.
- **AI Governance:** With regulatory scrutiny increasing, jobs in AI governance focus on compliance, ethical AI deployment, and risk management, ensuring AI systems adhere to legal and ethical standards[4].
- **AI Model Monitoring:** Specialists are needed to continuously monitor deployed AI models for security vulnerabilities, performance drift, and compliance breaches.

**Expert Opinions and Studies**

- Industry experts predict that AI will continue to open up more cybersecurity roles, especially in product security and leadership (e.g., Heads of Security), as new startups and enterprises prioritize secure AI deployment[5].
- However, experts also caution that as AI matures, especially with the advent of agentic (autonomous) AI, there will be a gradual reduction in entry-level cybersecurity jobs, as automation takes over routine tasks[5].

**Concrete Data Points**

- AI-related job postings peaked at 16,000 in October 2024, reflecting rapid expansion, with cybersecurity among the top domains hiring for AI skills[3].
- The percentage of all job postings demanding AI skills rose to 1.8% in 2025, up from 1.4% in 2023, indicating growing demand for AI expertise across the workforce, including security-focused roles[2].
- Salaries for AI engineers, including those in security, have surged, with averages reaching $206,000 in 2025—up $50,000 from the previous year, reflecting the premium on specialized AI and security skills[1].

**Job Market Analysis and Outlook**

- The demand for cybersecurity professionals with AI expertise is strongest in regions with established tech hubs, such as San Francisco, but is spreading due to hybrid work trends[3].
- While mid-level and executive opportunities are increasing, entry-level roles are becoming more competitive and less abundant, partly due to AI-driven automation of basic security tasks[5].
- The next five years are expected to see continued growth in AI-specialized cybersecurity roles, with a focus on operationalizing AI security, governance, and monitoring as organizations scale up their use of artificial intelligence[4].
