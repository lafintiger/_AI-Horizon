  "content": "Greg Isenberg Greg Isenberg is an Influencer CEO of Late Checkout, a portfolio of internet companies 1mo Edited Report this post LEAKED internal memo from CEO of Shopify Tobi Lutke around AI (see image below). 10 quick takeaways i have after reading it:\n\n1. a subtle but huge reframe: “hire an AI before you hire a human.”\n2. AI is now a baseline expectation at shopify. hiring filters will probably favor ai-fluent candidates at shopify and other companies.\n3. AI agents are now treated like teammates, not tools.\n4. prompting is now a core skill. top performers will be top prompters.\n5. AI usage is now measured. kinda wild. probably a business idea there to build the lattice for AI usage.\n6. AI-first prototyping is the new standard. shipping speed will probably 10x even at a $100B company like Shopify.\n7. org charts blur, headcount planning now includes bots, not just bodies.\n8. AI literacy is the new coding literacy. prompting, contextualizing, or evaluating ai output is become mandatory.\n9. AI is now a core layer in the software stack. not a plugin. not an add-on. ai sits beside infra, backend, frontend, and design. the best teams will be the ones who treat it like infrastructure.\n10. tobi’s memo screams one thing: more impact per person. shopify is early to this, but i bet this will hit every major company over the next 12-24 months.\n\nnote: we wrote an ebook on how to design startups in the AI age https://t.co/LYbOx1yipB (and giving it out for free). helpful for brands/startups looking to stand out in an AI age. 5,433 479 Comments Like Comment Share Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Jackson Foster Product @ Shopify 1mo Report this comment As a PM at Shopify, it's pretty cool to be empowered to think about how AI will improve entrepreneurs lives and ship experiments to those folks fast, and then iterate :) SO much cool stuff coming.

Half of these read like they were ai generated. Maybe I’m biased because the HR portal ai agent I tried today was some pre-canned text hot trash.

All this memo does is make me sad for the future. I’ve never seen so many people excited for layoffs.
