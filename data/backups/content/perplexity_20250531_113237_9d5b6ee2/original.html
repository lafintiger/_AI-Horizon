<em>
AI in Cyber 2024: Is the Cybersecurity Profession Ready?, a survey of
ISC2 members revealed that 88% are already seeing AI impact their
existing roles, with most seeing positives in the form of improved
efficiency despite concerns over redundancy of human tasks.
</em>
</p>
<p>
After decades of being a construct of science fiction, artificial
intelligence (AI), or at least advanced machine learning (ML) has made the
leap from fiction to reality. As a concept and technology, it has enjoyed an
exceptional acceleration in development and capability in the last decade.
</p>
<p>
That progress has particularly manifested itself in the form of
public-facing large language models (LLMs) in the form of ChatGPT, Google
PaLM and Gemini, Meta&rsquo;s LLaMA and more, all of which are forms of extensive
generative AI that can be leveraged to do almost anything from creating a
document on historic baseball wins to correctly writing and targeting a
phishing email in the language of a criminal&rsquo;s choosing. AI is everywhere
and while the cybersecurity industry was quick to adopt AI and ML as part of
its latest generation of defensive and monitoring technologies, so too have
the bad actors, who are leaning on the same technology to elevate the
sophistication, speed and accuracy of their own cybercrime activities.
</p>
<p>
ISC2 conducted a survey titled &ldquo;
<em>
AI in Cyber 2024: Is the Cybersecurity Profession Ready?&rdquo;
</em>
of 1,123 members who work, or have worked, in roles with security
responsibilities to understand the realities of how AI is impacting everyday
cybersecurity roles and tasks, as opposed to the perception of how its use
intersects with the roles of professionals.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><strong>It&rsquo;s Already Here</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt="" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide1.JPG?h=338&amp;w=601" style="height: 338px; width: 601px;" /></strong>
</p>
<p>A combined 54% of respondents note that there has been a substantial
increase in cyber threats over the last six months. That&rsquo;s made up of 13%
who are confident they can directly link that to AI-generated threats, and
41% who are unable to make a definitive connection. Arguably, if an AI LLM
is working well, you won&rsquo;t know the difference between automated and
human-based attacks. The clues will be more nuanced, such as speed and
repetition of attack that appear implausibly fast for a human (or a room
full of humans) to conduct.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, 35% of those surveyed stated that AI is already impacting their
daily job function. This is not a positive of negative measure, just
recognition of the fact AI plays a role. Be that dealing with AI driven
attacks, or working with AI-based tools such as automated monitoring
applications and AI-driven heuristic scanning. Add to the above those who
believe that AI will impact their job in the near future, and we see that
more than eight in 10 (88%) expect AI to significantly impact their jobs
over the next couple of years.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><strong>AI is Perceived as a Positive</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt="" height="338" width="601" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide2.JPG?h=338&amp;w=601" /></strong>
</p>
<p>How will that impact actually manifest as positive of negative input or
interference? The survey respondents are highly positive about the potential
for AI. Overall, 82% agree that AI will improve job efficiency for them as
cybersecurity professionals. That is countered by 56% also noting that AI
will make some parts of their job obsolete. Again, the obsolescence of job
functions isn&rsquo;t necessarily a negative, but rather noting the evolving
nature of the role of people in cybersecurity in the face of rapidly
evolving and autonomous software solutions, particularly those charged with
carrying out repetitive and time-consuming cybersecurity tasks.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="338" width="601" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide3.JPG?h=338&amp;w=601" /></p>
<p>When we asked respondents which job roles are being impacted by AI and ML,
we quickly see it&rsquo;s the time consuming and lower-value functions &ndash; precisely
the area where organizations would rather not have skilled people tied up.
For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>81% noted the scope for AI and ML to support analyzing user behavior
    patterns</li>
    <li>This was followed by 75% who mentioned automating repetitive tasks</li>
    <li>71% who see it being used to monitor network traffic for signs of
    malware</li>
    <li>A joint 62% who see it being used for predicting areas of weakness in
    the IT estate (also known as testing the fences) as well as
    automatically detecting and blocking threats</li>
</ul>
<p>
These functions all point to efficiencies over reductions in cybersecurity
roles. With a global cybersecurity workforce of 5,452,732 according to the
latest
<a href="https://media.isc2.org/-/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/documents/research/ISC2_Cybersecurity_Workforce_Study_2023.pdf?rev=28b46de71ce24e6ab7705f6e3da8637e&amp;hash=C45DB7A9F6BE8E7BB8E1915D8775690C">
ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study
</a>
, combined with a global workforce gap of 3,999,964, it is unlikely that AI
is going to make major inroads into closing the supply and demand divide,
but it will play a meaningful role in allowing the 5,452,732 to focus on
more complex, high value and critical tasks, perhaps alleviating some of the
workforce pressure.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><strong>AI as a Threat</strong></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Aside from how AI has become a key tool for the cybersecurity industry
itself, we must not overlook the role it is playing within the criminal
community to support attack and other malicious activities. Three quarters
of those surveyed were concerned that AI is, or will be used, as a means for
launching cyberattacks and other malicious criminal acts.
</p>
<p><img alt="" height="338" width="601" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide4.JPG?h=338&amp;w=601" /></p>
<p>With an appreciation that the technology is already serving both sides, it
was noted that right now, the currently level of AI and ML maturity is still
more likely to benefit cybersecurity professionals than it will help the
criminals. But it is a slim margin. Only 28% agreed, while 37% disagreed,
leaving nearly a third (32%) still unsure whether AI is more of a help to
cybersecurity than a hindrance.</p>
<p>
What are the threats being launched off the back of AI technology? We asked
respondents to list the ones that most concern them.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="338" width="601" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide5.JPG?h=338&amp;w=601" /></p>
<p>
There was a very clear bias towards misinformation-based attacks and
activities at the top of the list:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deepfakes (76%)</li>
    <li>Disinformation campaigns (70%)</li>
    <li>Social engineering (64%)<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img height="338" alt="World Map Showing Major Elections in 2024" width="601" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide6a.jpg?h=338&amp;w=601" /></p>
<p>This year is set to be one of the biggest for democratic elections in
history, with leadership elections taking place in seven of the world's 10
most populous nations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bangladesh</li>
    <li>India</li>
    <li>U.S.</li>
    <li>Indonesia</li>
    <li>Pakistan</li>
    <li>Russia</li>
    <li>Mexico</li>
</ul>
<p>
Alongside these, major elections are taking place in key economic and
resource-rich nations and blocs including the U.K., E.U., Iceland, South Africa, South
Korea, Azerbaijan, Republic of Ireland and Venezuela.
</p>
<p>
These are alongside regional and mayoral elections that in total will see 73
countries (plus all 27 members of the European Union) go to the polls at
least once in 2024. The UK will be the busiest at the ballot box, with 11
elections in total. There will be 10 major regional elections, plus a
general election for a new government and Prime Minister in 2024.
</p>
<p>
The fact that cybersecurity professionals are pointing to these types of
information and deception attacks as the biggest concern is understandably a
great worry for organizations, governments and citizens alike in this highly
political year.
</p>
<p><img alt="" height="338" width="600" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide7.JPG?h=338&amp;w=600" /></p>
<p>Other key AI-driven concerns are not attack based, but more regulatory and
best-practice drive. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The current lack of regulation (59%)</li>
    <li>Ethical concerns (57%)</li>
    <li>Privacy invasion (55%)</li>
    <li>The risk of data poisoning &ndash; intentional or accidental &ndash; (52%)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Attack-based concerns do start to re-emerge further down the list of
responses, with adversarial attacks (47%), IP theft (41%) and unauthorized
access (35%) all noted by respondents as a concern.
</p>
<p>
Strangely, at the bottom of the list was enhanced threat detection. 16% of
respondents are concerned that AI-based systems might be too good at what
they do, potential creating a myriad of issues for human operators including
false positives or overstepping into user privacy.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><strong>How Can We Be Better Prepared?</strong></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
By their own admission, survey respondents noted there&rsquo;s room for
improvement, but the preparedness for an influx of AI technology and
AI-based threats is not all negative:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Some 60% say they could confidently lead the rollout of AI in their
    organization</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, only a quarter (26%) said they were not prepared to deal with
    AI-driven security issues</li>
    <li>More concerning was that four in 10 (41%) said they have little or no
    experience in AI or ML, while a fifth (21%) said they don&rsquo;t know enough
    about AI to mitigate concerns</li>
</ul>
<p>
The conclusion is clear &ndash; education on AI use, best practice and efficiency
is a crucial requirement for all organizations today.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><strong>Creating Effective AI Policy</strong>
</h2>
<p><img alt="" height="338" width="601" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide8.JPG?h=338&amp;w=601" /></p>
<p>The fact that, despite its recent acceleration in technological capability
and advancement, AI and ML are both still in their technology infancy. This
is brought into stark contrast by the lack of organizational policy (as well
as government regulation) regarding the acquisition, use, access to data and
trust placed in AI technology:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Of the cybersecurity professionals we surveyed, only a quarter (27%)
    said their organizations had a formal policy in place on the safe and
    ethical use of AI</li>
    <li>Only 15% said they had a policy that covered securing and deploying AI
    technology today</li>
    <li>On the other side of the two questions, we find nearly 40% of
    respondents are still trying to develop a policy and a position. That&rsquo;s
    39% on ethics and 38% on safe and secure deployment</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, almost a fifth (18%) said their organizations have no plans
    to create a formal policy on AI in the near future</li>
    <li>Nearly one in five organizations surveyed are not ready for or preparing
    for AI technology either in or interfacing with their operations</li>
</ul>
<p>
Arguably, this is a cause for concern particularly given that government
regulation in many major economies has yet to catch up with the use of AI
technology. That said, four out of five respondents do see a clear need for
comprehensive and specific regulations governing the safe and ethical use of
AI:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Respondents were clear that governments need to take more of a lead if
    organizational policy is to catch up, even though 72% agreed that
    different types of AI will need their own tailored regulations</li>
    <li>Regardless, 63% said regulation of AI should come from collaborative
    government efforts (ensuring standardization across borders) and 54%
    wanting national governments to take the lead</li>
    <li>In addition, 61% would also like to see AI experts coming together to
    support the regulation effort, while 28% favor private sector
    self-regulation</li>
    <li>Only 3% want to retain the current unregulated environment</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" height="338" width="601" src="https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide9.JPG?h=338&amp;w=601" /></p>
<p>Given the lack of policy and regulation, how are organizations governing who
should have access to AI technology? The fact is there is no common
approach:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The survey revealed that 12% of respondents said their organizations had
    blocked all access to generative AI tools in the workplace. So, no using
    ChatGPT to write that difficult customer letter any time soon!</li>
    <li>However, 17% are not even discussing the issue, while around a third
    each are allowing access to some (32%) or all (29%) generative AI tools
    in the workplace</li>
    <li>A further 10% simply don&rsquo;t know what their organization is doing in this
    regard</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>What Does This Mean for You?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, this study and the feedback of ISC2 members working on the front
line of cybersecurity highlights that we are in an environment where threats
are rising, at least partly due to the use of AI, at a time when the
workforce is struggling to grow to meet the demand.
</p>
<p>
There are no standards on how organizations are approaching internal AI
regulation, with little government-driven legal regulation at this stage.
Cybersecurity professionals want meaningful regulations governing the safe
and ethical use of AI to serve as a catalyst for formalizing operational
policy.
</p>
<p>
There is no doubt that AI is going to change and redefine many cybersecurity
roles, removing people from certain high-speed and repetitive tasks, but is
less likely to eliminate human cybersecurity jobs completely. However, as
the technology is still in its infancy, education is paramount. Education
will play a critical role in ensuring that today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s
cybersecurity professionals are able to adapt and fully utilize the
efficiency and operational benefits of AI technology, maintain clear ethical
boundaries as well as respond to AI-driven threats. Seeking out education
opportunities is essential for cybersecurity professionals to continue
playing a leading role in the evolution of AI in the sector.</p>

As a concept and technology, it has enjoyed an\nexceptional acceleration in development and capability in the last decade.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThat progress has particularly manifested itself in the form of\npublic-facing large language models (LLMs) in the form of ChatGPT, Google\nPaLM and Gemini, Meta\u0026rsquo;s LLaMA and more, all of which are forms of extensive\ngenerative AI that can be leveraged to do almost anything from creating a\ndocument on historic baseball wins to correctly writing and targeting a\nphishing email in the language of a criminal\u0026rsquo;s choosing. AI is everywhere\nand while the cybersecurity industry was quick to adopt AI and ML as part of\nits latest generation of defensive and monitoring technologies, so too have\nthe bad actors, who are leaning on the same technology to elevate the\nsophistication, speed and accuracy of their own cybercrime activities.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nISC2 conducted a survey titled \u0026ldquo;\n\u003cem\u003e\nAI in Cyber 2024: Is the Cybersecurity Profession Ready?\u0026rdquo;\n\u003c/em\u003e\nof 1,123 members who work, or have worked, in roles with security\nresponsibilities to understand the realities of how AI is impacting everyday\ncybersecurity roles and tasks, as opposed to the perception of how its use\nintersects with the roles of professionals.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s Already Here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide1.JPG?h=338\u0026amp;w=601\" style=\"height: 338px; width: 601px;\" /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA combined 54% of respondents note that there has been a substantial\nincrease in cyber threats over the last six months.

Arguably, if an AI LLM\nis working well, you won\u0026rsquo;t know the difference between automated and\nhuman-based attacks. The clues will be more nuanced, such as speed and\nrepetition of attack that appear implausibly fast for a human (or a room\nfull of humans) to conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFurthermore, 35% of those surveyed stated that AI is already impacting their\ndaily job function. This is not a positive of negative measure, just\nrecognition of the fact AI plays a role. Be that dealing with AI driven\nattacks, or working with AI-based tools such as automated monitoring\napplications and AI-driven heuristic scanning.

Ready?, a survey of\nISC2 members revealed that 88% are already seeing AI impact their\nexisting roles, with most seeing positives in the form of improved\nefficiency despite concerns over redundancy of human tasks.\n\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nAfter decades of being a construct of science fiction, artificial\nintelligence (AI), or at least advanced machine learning (ML) has made the\nleap from fiction to reality. As a concept and technology, it has enjoyed an\nexceptional acceleration in development and capability in the last decade.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nThat progress has particularly manifested itself in the form of\npublic-facing large language models (LLMs) in the form of ChatGPT, Google\nPaLM and Gemini, Meta\u0026rsquo;s LLaMA and more, all of which are forms of extensive\ngenerative AI that can be leveraged to do almost anything from creating a\ndocument on historic baseball wins to correctly writing and targeting a\nphishing email in the language of a criminal\u0026rsquo;s choosing. AI is everywhere\nand while the cybersecurity industry was quick to adopt AI and ML as part of\nits latest generation of defensive and monitoring technologies, so too have\nthe bad actors, who are leaning on the same technology to elevate the\nsophistication, speed and accuracy of their own cybercrime activities.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nISC2 conducted a survey titled \u0026ldquo;\n\u003cem\u003e\nAI in Cyber 2024: Is the Cybersecurity Profession Ready?\u0026rdquo;\n\u003c/em\u003e\nof 1,123 members who work, or have worked, in roles with security\nresponsibilities to understand the realities of how AI is impacting everyday\ncybersecurity roles and tasks, as opposed to the perception of how its use\nintersects with the roles of professionals.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s Already Here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide1.JPG?h=338\u0026amp;w=601\" style=\"height: 338px; width: 601px;\" /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA combined 54% of respondents note that there has been a substantial\nincrease in cyber threats over the last six months. That\u0026rsquo;s made up of 13%\nwho are confident they can directly link that to AI-generated threats, and\n41% who are unable to make a definitive connection. Arguably, if an AI LLM\nis working well, you won\u0026rsquo;t know the difference between automated and\nhuman-based attacks. The clues will be more nuanced, such as speed and\nrepetition of attack that appear implausibly fast for a human (or a room\nfull of humans) to conduct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\nFurthermore, 35% of those surveyed stated that AI is already impacting their\ndaily job function. This is not a positive of negative measure, just\nrecognition of the fact AI plays a role. Be that dealing with AI driven\nattacks, or working with AI-based tools such as automated monitoring\napplications and AI-driven heuristic scanning. Add to the above those who\nbelieve that AI will impact their job in the near future, and we see that\nmore than eight in 10 (88%) expect AI to significantly impact their jobs\nover the next couple of years.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAI is Perceived as a Positive\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" height=\"338\" width=\"601\" src=\"https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/internationf173-xmc4e73-prodbc0f-9660/media/Project/ISC2/Main/Media/insights/Features/2024/02/Slide2.JPG?h=338\u0026amp;w=601\" /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow will that impact actually manifest as positive of negative input or\ninterference? The survey respondents are highly positive about the potential\nfor AI. Overall, 82% agree that AI will improve job efficiency for them as\ncybersecurity professionals.
