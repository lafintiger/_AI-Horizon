  "content": "## AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps, and AI Governance Roles: 2024–2025 Job Market Analysis\n\n**Current Trends and Developments**\n\nThe rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cybersecurity has led to the emergence of specialized roles such as AI Security Engineer, MLSecOps (Machine Learning Security Operations), and AI Governance professionals. Organizations are increasingly seeking experts who can secure AI/ML systems, ensure compliance with evolving regulations, and address risks unique to AI technologies. This trend is evident in the significant number of job postings and the expansion of responsibilities within these roles[1][3][4].\n\n**Specific Examples and Job Functions**\n\n- **AI Security Engineer**: Major companies like Amazon are hiring AI Security Engineers to secure AI applications, conduct code reviews for security vulnerabilities, build security frameworks, and develop automation tools for risk reduction. These roles also involve creating threat models, performing security research, and providing security training to development teams[4][5].\n- **MLSecOps**: While not always listed as a distinct title, MLSecOps responsibilities are embedded in roles focusing on the secure deployment and monitoring of machine learning models, integrating security practices throughout the AI/ML lifecycle.\n- **AI Governance and Explainability**: There is growing demand for professionals who can ensure AI systems comply with regulations, are explainable, and are auditable. These roles often overlap with cybersecurity analyst positions, requiring expertise in both technical and regulatory domains.\n\n**Expert Opinions and Industry Studies**\n\nIndustry reports and expert commentary highlight that the intersection of AI and cybersecurity is creating a new class of hybrid jobs. The World Economic Forum and major consulting firms predict that AI will both automate certain cybersecurity tasks and create new opportunities for professionals with AI, security, and governance expertise. The need for explainable AI and robust AI governance frameworks is driving demand for analysts who can interpret AI decisions and ensure transparency in security-critical environments.\n\n**Concrete Data Points**\n\n- As of May 2025, there are over 31,000 AI security job postings in the United States, with salaries ranging from $43,000 to $220,000, reflecting the high demand and specialized skill set required[3].\n- Indeed lists nearly 500 AI Security Engineer positions, with responsibilities including compliance, risk monitoring, and vulnerability assessment in AI-powered environments[1].\n- In specific regions like Dallas, TX, there are dozens of open AI security roles, indicating geographic as well as sectoral growth[2].\n\n**Impact on the Cybersecurity Workforce**\n\nThe rise of AI in cybersecurity is reshaping the workforce in several ways:\n\n- **Job Creation**: New roles such as AI Security Engineer, AI Governance Specialist, and Explainable AI Analyst are being created to address the unique challenges of securing and governing AI systems.\n- **Skill Evolution**: Traditional cybersecurity analysts are upskilling to include AI/ML security, model explainability, and regulatory compliance in their portfolios.\n- **Cross-Disciplinary Demand**: Employers are seeking candidates with a blend of cybersecurity, data science, and regulatory expertise, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of modern AI security challenges.\n\n## Summary Table: Key AI-Cybersecurity Roles and Trends (2024–2025)\n\n| Role                        | Core Responsibilities                                 | Demand (2025)         | Example Employers           |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| AI Security Engineer        | Secure AI apps, code review, automation, threat modeling | Very High (31,000+ jobs)[3] | Amazon, Inmar Intelligence[4][5] |\n| MLSecOps                    | Secure ML pipelines, monitor model integrity         | Growing               | Tech & financial sectors   |\n| AI Governance Specialist    | Ensure compliance, audit AI systems, explainability  | High                  | Consulting, finance        |\n| Explainable AI Analyst      | Interpret AI decisions, transparency, risk analysis  | Emerging              | Regulated industries       |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe impact of artificial intelligence on the cybersecurity workforce is profound and accelerating. The job market is experiencing robust growth in specialized roles that blend AI, security, and governance expertise. Organizations are prioritizing AI security and explainability, leading to both the creation of new jobs and the transformation of existing cybersecurity roles[1][3][4][5]. This trend is expected to continue as AI adoption expands and regulatory scrutiny increases.",
