Data Points\n\n- As of 2025, there are more than 500,000 open roles globally for AI and ML engineers, with the largest concentrations in the US, India, and China[1].\n- Machine Learning Engineers, AI Engineers, and Deep Learning Specialists are among the most sought-after roles, with AI Agent Engineers emerging as a critical new specialization[4].\n- Cybersecurity roles in highest demand for 2025 include Cybersecurity Analyst, Cloud Security Engineer, and Security Architect, all increasingly requiring AI expertise[3].\n\n## Expert Opinions and Industry Insights\n\n- AI is driving a high demand for tech jobs that require both traditional cybersecurity skills and new AI-specific competencies, such as prompt engineering and AI governance[4].\n- The rise of autonomous AI tools is creating entirely new roles (e.g., AI Agent Engineer) that blend security, engineering, and operational expertise[4].\n- Organizations are prioritizing security to protect sensitive data and infrastructure, with a particular focus on AI-driven threats and regulatory compliance[3][5].\n\n## Enterprise Cybersecurity Workforce: AI’s Impact\n\n- Enterprises are rapidly hiring for roles that combine cybersecurity and AI expertise, especially in areas like MLSecOps, AI governance, and prompt engineering[4][5].\n- The integration of AI into security operations (SecOps) is leading to increased demand for professionals who can manage AI-powered detection, response, and automation tools[5].\n- AI is not replacing cybersecurity jobs but transforming them—requiring upskilling and the creation of hybrid roles that did not exist a few years ago[4][5].\n\n## Summary Table: Key AI-Driven Cybersecurity Roles (2024–2025)\n\n| Role                          | Core Focus
