2. **Via Scripts**: Use collection scripts in `/scripts/collection/`
3. **Direct Upload**: Place files in `/data/uploads/` and process

### Running Analysis
```bash
# Generate comprehensive reports
python scripts/generate_web_report.py

# Analyze quality metrics
python scripts/analysis/analyze_successful_articles.py

# Check system status
python scripts/analysis/check_status.py
```

### Quality Score Management
```python
# Calculate quality for all documents
from scripts.analysis.implement_quality_ranking import DocumentQualityRanker
ranker = DocumentQualityRanker()
ranked_docs = ranker.rank_all_documents()
