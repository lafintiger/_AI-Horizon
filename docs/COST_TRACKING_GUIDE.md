# üí∞ AI-Horizon Cost Tracking Guide

The AI-Horizon system now includes comprehensive cost tracking for all API usage, helping you monitor spending and optimize collection strategies.

## üéØ Cost Tracking Features

### Real-Time Dashboard Monitoring
- **Session Cost**: Cost accumulation for current session
- **Total Cost**: Historical cost across all time
- **Cost per Article**: Average cost for each article collected
- **Estimated Full Run**: Projected cost for 80-article collection
- **Runs per $100**: How many collections you can afford monthly

### API Cost Breakdown
- **Perplexity API**: ~$0.001 per 1000 tokens (primary service)
- **OpenAI API**: ~$0.002 per 1000 tokens (if integrated)
- **Anthropic API**: ~$0.015 per 1000 tokens (if integrated)

## üìä Using the Cost Tracker

### 1. Web Dashboard
Navigate to the status dashboard at `http://localhost:5000` to see:
- Real-time cost updates during collection
- Session vs. total cost tracking
- Budget analysis and recommendations

### 2. Cost Analysis Tool
Run detailed cost analysis from command line:

```bash
# Basic analysis with $100 monthly budget
python analyze_costs.py

# Custom budget analysis
python analyze_costs.py --budget 50

# Advanced budget scenarios
python analyze_costs.py --budget 200
```

### 3. API Endpoints
- `POST /api/reset_session_cost` - Reset session cost tracking
- `GET /api/database_stats` - Includes cost information
- `POST /api/add_cost` - Manually add cost (for testing)

## üí° Budget Recommendations

### Typical Collection Costs (80 articles)
- **Standard Collection**: ~$0.24 using Perplexity
- **Targeted Collection**: ~$0.15-0.30 depending on complexity
- **Student Intelligence**: ~$0.20-0.35 for specialized queries

### Monthly Budget Scenarios
| Budget | Collections/Month | Frequency | Best For |
|--------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| $25    | ~104             | Daily     | Development/Testing |
| $50    | ~208             | Multiple Daily | Regular Monitoring |
| $100   | ~416             | Continuous | Full Research Operation |
| $200   | ~833             | High Frequency | Enterprise Usage |

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. **Use Targeted Collections**: Focus on specific categories to reduce redundant queries
2. **Monitor Cost per Article**: Aim for <$0.003 per article
3. **Reset Session Costs**: Track individual run costs for optimization
4. **Batch Collections**: Run larger collections less frequently vs. small frequent ones

```

### Collection Frequency Recommendations
```
üéØ COLLECTION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDATIONS:
   With $100.0 budget:
     ‚Ä¢ ~416 full collections per month     # Maximum possible
     ‚Ä¢ ~104.0 collections per week         # Weekly allocation
     ‚Ä¢ One collection every 0.1 days      # Frequency
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Historical Cost Tracking
All costs are stored in `data/costs/cost_tracking.json`:
- Daily cost breakdowns
- API-specific usage patterns
- Token consumption trends
- Cost per collection metrics

### Integration with Collection Scripts
Cost tracking is automatically integrated with:
- `collect_comprehensive.py`
- `collect_targeted_sources.py`
- `collect_student_intelligence.py`

### Real-Time Updates
The status dashboard receives real-time cost updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE), showing:
- Live cost accumulation during collection
- Updated budget analysis
- Cost efficiency metrics

## üö® Budget Monitoring Alerts

### Dashboard Indicators
- **Green**: Well within budget (< 50% utilization)
- **Yellow**: Moderate usage (50-80% utilization)
- **Red**: High usage (> 80% utilization)

### Automated Recommendations
The system provides automatic recommendations based on:
- Current spending velocity
- Historical efficiency
- Budget constraints
- Collection goals

## üìù Best Practices

### 1. Budget Setting
- **Development**: $25-50/month
- **Research**: $100-200/month
- **Production**: $200-500/month

### 2. Cost Monitoring
- Check dashboard before major collections
- Run cost analysis weekly
- Reset session costs between projects
- Monitor cost per article trends

### 3. Optimization Strategies
- Use targeted collections for focused research
- Avoid overlapping queries
- Monitor duplicate detection effectiveness
- Adjust query complexity based on cost efficiency

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Cost not updating**: Restart the status server
2. **High cost per article**: Review query complexity and duplication
3. **Budget alerts**: Check `analyze_costs.py` for detailed breakdown

### Support Commands
```bash
# Reset all cost tracking
rm data/costs/cost_tracking.json

# View raw cost data
cat data/costs/cost_tracking.json

# Test cost tracking
python -c "from aih.utils.cost_tracker import cost_tracker; print(cost_tracker.costs)"
```
