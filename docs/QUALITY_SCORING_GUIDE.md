# Quality Scoring System Guide

This guide explains the comprehensive document quality scoring system implemented in AI-Horizon, which evaluates and ranks all content to ensure high-quality, actionable intelligence for cybersecurity professionals.

## Overview

The AI-Horizon quality scoring system provides real-time assessment of document quality using multiple evaluation dimensions. Every document receives a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0, with visual indicators and automatic sorting to prioritize the most valuable content.

## Quality Scoring Framework

### Scoring Dimensions

The quality ranking system evaluates documents across four key dimensions:

#### 1. Content Depth Score (25% weight)
- **Text Complexity**: Measures vocabulary sophistication and sentence structure
- **Information Density**: Evaluates the amount of substantive information per unit of text
- **Technical Detail**: Assesses the presence of specific, actionable cybersecurity information
- **Evidence Support**: Checks for examples, case studies, and supporting data

#### 2. Source Authority Score (30% weight)
- **Domain Credibility**: Evaluates the reputation and authority of the source domain
- **Publication Standards**: Assesses editorial oversight and content review processes
- **Author Expertise**: Considers author credentials and subject matter expertise
- **Citation Patterns**: Analyzes how often the source is referenced by other authorities

#### 3. Relevance Score (25% weight)
- **Career Applicability**: Measures direct relevance to cybersecurity career development
- **Actionability**: Evaluates how easily insights can be translated into career actions
- **Target Audience Alignment**: Assesses suitability for 2025 cybersecurity graduates
- **Temporal Relevance**: Considers currency and future-oriented perspective

#### 4. Completeness Score (20% weight)
- **Article Structure**: Evaluates logical organization and comprehensive coverage
- **Information Coverage**: Assesses whether key aspects of the topic are addressed
- **Supporting Materials**: Checks for additional resources, links, and references
- **Conclusion Quality**: Evaluates the presence of actionable takeaways

### Quality Grades

Quality scores are translated into user-friendly grades with visual indicators:

| Grade | Score Range | Color | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **Excellent** | 0.8 - 1.0 | ðŸŸ¢ Green | Comprehensive, high-authority content ready for immediate use |
| **Good** | 0.6 - 0.8 | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | Solid content suitable for analysis with minor enhancement |
| **Fair** | 0.4 - 0.6 | ðŸŸ  Orange | Acceptable content requiring validation or supplementation |
| **Poor** | 0.0 - 0.4 | ðŸ”´ Red | Limited quality requiring review or removal |
