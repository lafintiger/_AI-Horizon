EAGER: NAIRR Pilot Expansion: FA1: AI Horizon: Forecasting Cybersecurity Workforce
Evolution and Adaptive Skill Development
Overview
The integration of AI into cybersecurity represents a fundamental transformation occurring at
unprecedented speed. AI Horizon addresses the critical gap between rapid technological
evolution and educational adaptation through a novel forecasting framework. This high-risk,
high-reward initiative ($300,000 over two years) will predict which cybersecurity tasks will be
augmented by AI, replaced by AI, or remain human-driven, enabling educators to adapt
curriculum with unprecedented agility.
California State University, San Bernardino will implement this project through: (1) a
Forecasting Committee identifying emerging AI-driven changes in cybersecurity workforce
needs; (2) a Program Committee translating forecasts into educational strategies; and (3)
partnership with Redwood Consulting for rigorous assessment. Workshops at major events (CAE
Symposium, CYAD, SFS Job Fair) will reach ~1,000 academics and ~1,000 students annually,
with sustainability ensured through curriculum repositories and an eventual self-sustaining
conference model.
Intellectual Merit
AI Horizon advances knowledge through: (1) a data-driven forecasting framework that
systematically maps AI's transformation of cybersecurity domains; (2) a novel three-committee
implementation model that rapidly translates workforce insights into educational strategies; (3)
innovative mechanisms for integrating NAIRR resources into cybersecurity education; and (4)
advanced methodologies measuring the effectiveness of rapid curriculum adaptation. This
approach represents a radical departure from traditional educational practices by compressing
adaptation cycles from years to weeks.
Broader Impacts
The project strengthens national security by accelerating AI integration into cybersecurity
education, creating more robust defense capabilities. It drives educational transformation by
providing scalable models for rapid curriculum adaptation across 470 CAE institutions. By
aligning education with emerging workplace requirements, it improves job placement outcomes
and career readiness. Through effective guidance on NAIRR resource utilization, AI Horizon
maximizes the impact of national AI investments on cybersecurity research and education.
This transformative approach bridges the growing gap between traditional cybersecurity
education and the AI-enhanced workplace, addressing a critical national security imperative that
no existing NSF program currently targets. By combining rigorous workforce forecasting with
immediate classroom implementation, AI Horizon will help ensure that U.S. cybersecurity
education keeps pace with technological advancement, maintaining our nation's security in an
increasingly AI-driven world.
